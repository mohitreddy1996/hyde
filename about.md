Hello World! I am Mohit Reddy. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}/public/about-me-pic.jpg" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="http://nitk.ac.in/">National Institute of Technology, Karnataka</a>.

My interests lie in Computer Science related topics like Distributed Systems, Algorithms, Data structures and Machine Learning. Currently I am trying to explore Distributed Systems in-depth and in my free time try to take part in a featured <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle contest</a> or atleast go through the discussions section of them and read about interesting things I find there.

Along with Computer Science, I love sports and follow several of them ardently. I play and have represented Cricket and Basketball for High School/University level. I follow Tennis (Huge Roger Federer Fan!) and UFC (Mixed Martial Arts). I try to watch the highlights, if not the entire match, of Real Madrid C.F.
